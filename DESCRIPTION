Description: BulkCAT calculates conservation status metrics for multiple species using user-supplied point occurrence data with WGS84 latitude and longitude coordinates.
 This package implements a bulk-processing version of the "Conservation status Assessment Tool" (CAT) methodology from IUCN and NatureServe.
 For each species, it computes extent of occurrence (EOO in kmÂ²), area of occupancy (AOO, number of 2x2 km grid cells), number of hypothetical Element Occurrences (EOs), and an overall rarity rank.
 This allows efficient multi-species assessments at scales not feasible with interactive tools like GeoCAT or RARECAT. Calculated values may differ from RARECAT by ~1% for large datasets.
